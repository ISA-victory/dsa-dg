# SECTION 1. ABSTRACT DATA TYPES (ADT) 

## 1.1. ADT concept

Before describing data structures in the programming language Golang
should start with the concepts of \'data\', \'data type\' and \'data
structure\'. In the most general sense, data is any unstructured set
(collection) of characters that are collected and processed for any
purpose, primarily to extract information for subsequent acquisition of
knowledge and meanings. Data structures manifold was predetermined the
appearance of a data type category . The data type should be understood
as an atomic, indivisible data unity, defined either by the programming
language standard or by the user, and representing a set of real-world
objects at the level of their most essential parameters. Generalization
of experience of application of different types of data in different
programming languages led to the emergence of the «abstract data type»
category.

The data types were first described by D. Knuth in his classical work
"The Art of Programming" \[Knut\], in which the author described data
structures defined as ways of organizing data within a program. Together
with the description of the data structures themselves, Knuth provides
the "processing algorithms" of these structures in a language of special
terms, reflecting actions with elements of this structure, such as
structure size, adding a new element, push and pop items, etc.

In most literary sources, the abstract data type is understood as a
mathematical model that defines a set of data values (carrier set) and a
set of methods for handling that data (method set). Here are some
examples of ATD:

*Boolean -* the logical ATD is a set of values {true, false}. The set of
methods includes comparison operators (as well as logical operations &&,
II, ==, !=).

*Integer -* integer ATD is a set of {\/drakongobook/., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \/drakongobook/.}, and
the set of methods includes addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, remainder of division, change of sign, etc.

*String -* аn ATD string set is a set of all finite sequences of
characters in a certain alphabet, including an empty sequence (an empty
string). The set of methods includes concatenation, definition of string
length, substring, character index, etc.

*Bit string -- the* carrier set of bit string is a set of all
end-sequences of bits, including empty bits strings. The set of ATD
method of bit string includes a complement (which flips all bits),
shifts (which rotate a string of bits left or right), connection and
disjunction (which merge bits at appropriate locations in strings),
concatenation and truncation.

The author of the outstanding work «Perfect Code» S. McConnell
significantly expanded the concept of ATD and drew attention to the fact
that abstract data types «allow to work with entities of the real world,
and not with low-level entities of implementation». In
particular, these entities are data structures for organizing the
computing process. The simplified classification of abstract data
structures can be presented as follows (Figure 1.1.)

```
<p style="text-align: center;"> Figure 1.1. Data structures classification</p>

Let\'s take a closer look at the classification. Note that each of these
structures has its own advantages and disadvantages, which predetermines
the need for their thorough analysis in terms of computer memory costs
and access time to their elements. In this work, the main attention is
focused on data structures presented in RAM. First of all, data
structures are divided into linear and non-linear. In a linear data
structure, its elements are contiguous, that is, the data is ordered
sequentially. Such designs are quite simple to implement. At the same
time, linear data structures do not provide efficient use of memory.

In non-linear data structures, the organization of elements is not
sequential. Data elements in a non-linear structure may be connected to
several other data elements to reflect special relationships between
them. In addition, in non-linear structures, it is impossible to go
through the elements in one pass. Nonlinear data structures include
maps, dictionaries, trees, and graphs. Homogeneous data structures
include most of these data structures, non-homogeneous - structures that
consist of data of a different nature. For example, lists are based on
nodes, represented by structures that include two fields: a numerical
value and the address of the next node. Typical examples of
heterogeneous structure are *dictionaries, maps, and hash tables*.
Let\'s consider the main abstract data types according to the principle
of linearity.

## 1.2.  Linear Abstract Data Types

### 1.2.1 Array and Slice

Let\'s start with the fundamental abstract data type, the array. The
fundamental nature of an array, as a data structure, lies in their
direct correspondence to memory systems on all computers. To retrieve
the contents of a word from memory, machine language requires an
address. Thus, the entire memory of the computer can be considered as an
array, where memory addresses correspond to indices. Most machine
language processors translate programs that use arrays into efficient
machine language programs that access memory directly.

An array is a fixed set of same-type data that is stored as a continuous
sequence, the indexing of which elements can start with 0 or 1. When
created and initialized, the array is declared via an identifier or an
address pointer at the initial address (0 or 1) element (Figure 1.2).


```{image} C:/Users/ISA_PC/.jupyter/projectBook/drakongo/Engl_images/E_Im1/Fig1_2_Array.jpg
:width: 400px
:align: center
```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1.2. Array declaration method (<i>p</i> - cell address <i>a[0]</i>)</p>

The choice of declaration type determines how individual elements are
accessed. The entry *a\[i\],* where a is an identifier, refers us to the
*i-th* element of the array. At the same time, an array can be declared
using a pointer, which refers the program code to the address of the
initial element of the array. In most languages ​​that use the concept of
pointers, an array is specified by the expression: *\*pa*, and the real
address in a hexadecimal expression is specified by the character &: *pa
= &a\[0\].* If *pa* points to some element of the array, then *pa+1* by
definition points to the next element, *pa+i* to the *i-th* element
after pa, and *pa-i* to the *i-th* element before *pa*. So if *pa*
points to *a\[0\]*, then *\*(pa+1)* is the content of *a\[1\], a+i* is
the address of *a\[i\]*, a *\*(pa+i)* is the content of *a\[i\].*

There is one difference between an array name and a pointer acting as an
array name. A pointer is a variable, so pa = a can be written, but an
array name is not a variable, and entries like a = pa are not allowed.
Consider the most common properties of an array as an abstract data
type:

• All array elements belong to the same type (homogeneity);

• The size of the array is set once and does not change during the
operation (persistence);

• All array elements have the same access (equity);

• All elements are arranged sequentially in RAM cells (location
sequence);

• Array elements are uniquely identified by their indices (indexing);

• Indexes must be a simple ordinal data type.

It should be noted that any abstract data type consists of a set of
values and a set of methods. For an array, the main methods are:

• Get element with number N;

• Record element with number N;

• Get the size of an array.

The advantages of ATD «array» include:

-   Arrays store multiple data types with the same name.

-   It provides arbitrary access to elements.

-   Since the array is fixed size and stored in adjacent memory regions,
    there is no memory shortage or overflow.

-   It is useful to store any type of data with a fixed size.

-   Because elements in an array are stored in adjacent areas of memory,
    it is easy to iterate in this data structure, and access to the
    element, if known, takes a unit of time.

 Limitations of array data structure include:

-   The size of the array must be known in advance.

-   An array is a static data structure with a fixed size, so the array
    size cannot be changed additionally, and therefore no changes can be
    made during execution.

-   Insertion and deletion operations are expensive in arrays because
    elements are stored in continuous memory.

-   If the size of the advertised array exceeds the required size, this
    can result in memory loss.

This disadvantage can be overcome by introducing an abstract data type
 such like *slice*. *Slice* is a flexible and variable data structure
 consisting of several elements of the same type. Like arrays, the
 slice is indexed and has a size (length) that can be programmatically
 regulated (increasing and decreasing) by having such a property like
 *capacity*. The slice capacity is the number of elements in the base
 array, counting from the first element in a slice. If a slice has
 sufficient capacity, then its length can be increased by it
 re-slicing. The slice may consist of three elements: *a pointer*
 indicating the first slice element, a length (slice element number)
 and a capacity - the maximum size to which it can be extended (Figure
 1.3.):

:width: 300px
:align: center
```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1.3. Slice and it components</p>

The main methods for slice are the operations of adding, removing,
determining a slice length, changing a capacitance. The program
implementation of Golang slice (declaration, initialization, basic
methods of working with this type of data) is described in more detail
in the next section.

### 1.2.2. Linked List

A list is an ordered set consisting of a variable number of elements to
which inclusion and deletion operations apply. A list reflecting the
neighbourhood between elements is called linear. The list length is
equal to the number of elements in the list. If the component is not
related to any other, the index field contains a value that does not
indicate any element. This link is indicated by a special name - null.

There are three common types of connected types:

-   Singly linked list;

-   Doubly Linked list;

-   Circular Linked List.

**a) Singly linked list**

Figure 1.4. shows the structure of the simply connected list, where the
field *item* is containing *data*, the next one - *pointer* to the next
element of the list. Each list must have a special element called the
top of the list or head of the list, which is usually different in
format from the rest of the items. In the index field of the last
element of the list there is special feature null indicating the end of
the list (Figure 1.4):

```{image} C:/Users/ISA_PC/.jupyter/projectBook/drakongo/Engl_images/E_Im1/Fig1_4_List.jpg
:width: 400px
:align: center
```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1.4. Single-linked list (item -> data; next -> *pointer* to the next element)</p>

Single-linked list, thus defined, has a number of properties:

-   The size of a list is the number of elements in it, excluding the
    last \"zero\" element, which is by definition an empty list.

-   The element type is the type on which the list is built; all items
    in the list must be of this type.

-   Sorting - the list can be sorted according to some sort criteria
    (for example, by increasing integer values if the list consists of
    integers).

-   Access capabilities - some lists, depending on the implementation,
    can provide the programmer with selectors to access directly to a
    given number.

-   Comparability - lists can be compared against each other for
    consistency, and depending on the implementation, the list
    comparison operation can use different technologies.

Below is some set of functions that can be performed over the ATD list:

• Initialize the list;

• Insert a new element;

• Remove any element;

• Find the k-th element;

• Read the next element;

• Printing elements;

**b) Doubly linked list**

In some cases, it is necessary to include links on both sides. In this
case, both direct and reverse access is possible. It is defined as a
sequence of nodes, where each node defines a region of memory. Each node
is divided into three fields: *item* is the data field, *next* is the
address of the next field, or forward field, and the previous, or
reverse field. The data field is used to store data values. The *prev*
field is used to store the address of the previous element, *next* is
used to store the address of the next element. The first node of the
previous field and the last node of the next field are always zero
(Figure 1.5.).

```{image} C:/Users/ISA_PC/.jupyter/projectBook/drakongo/Engl_images/E_Im1/Fig1_5_DoubleList.jpg
:width: 400px
:align: center
```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1.5. Doubly linked list</p>

The properties and functions for the biconnected list are almost the
same as for the simply connected list. The main advantage of the
two-linked list is that it simplifies many operations; the main drawback
is the extra memory required for address pointers.

**c) Circular linked list**

A variation of the types of linear lists considered is the circular
list, which can be organized on the basis of both simple and two-linked
lists. In this case, in the simply connected list, the pointer of the
last element should point to the first element; in the two-linked list
in the first and last element, the corresponding pointers are
overridden, as shown in Figure 1.6.

```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1.6. Circular list structure</p>

When working with ring lists, some procedures are also simplified;
however, when viewing such a list, you should take some precautions not
to get into the infinite loop.

Some procedures are simplified when dealing with such lists. However,
when viewing such a list, you should take certain precautions not to get
into an endless cycle.

### 1.2.3.  Stack and Queue

The stack is a dynamic, ever-changing set of data, the addition and
deletion of which are performed solely on the principle of \"last logged
in, first went out\" (Last-In-First-Out or LIFO) (Figure 1.7). The stack
works like manipulating a stack of books, which are shaped by actions to
delete and add books.

```{image} C:/Users/ISA_PC/.jupyter/projectBook/drakongo/Engl_images/E_Im1/Fig1_7_Stack.jpg
:width: 200px
:align: center
```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1.7. Stack structure</p>

Stacks are widely used in various data processing scenarios, such as
implementing \"undo\" in text editors; this operation is performed by
storing all text changes to the stack. The stack is often used to
organize methods calls and recursions.

The main operations that can be performed on the stack are:

• Add new data;

• Remove data from the stack;

• Return (without removing) the top value;

• Check stack full status;

In many programming languages, the stack is created either from an array
or from a single-linked list. The Golang language can apply the concept
of interfaces, which will be discussed further.

Unlike the ATD stack, which has much in common with the stack, elements
are added (enqueue) and removed (dequeue) from different ends. This
method is called \"first entered, first released\" (First-In-First-Out
or FIFO). That is, elements are taken from the queue in the same order
in which they are placed (Figure 1.8).

```{image} C:/Users/ISA_PC/.jupyter/projectBook/drakongo/Engl_images/E_Im1/Fig1_8_Queue.jpg
:width: 400px
:align: center
```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1.8. Data structure "Queue"</p>

The following functions are used to manipulate queue components.

• Create a new empty queue;

• Add a new element to the end of the queue;

• Remove the front element from the queue;

• Check the queue for emptiness;

• Check the queue for filling;

• Determine the length (number of elements) in the queue.

The data type of the queue can have several varieties:

A *circular queue* is an extended version of a regular queue in which
the last element is connected to the first element, resulting in a
circular structure. Circular queue solves the main constraint of regular
queue - inefficient memory usage.

*A priority queue* is a special type of queue in which each element is
associated with a priority value. And the elements are serviced on the
basis of their priority. That is, the higher priority elements are
served first. However, if items with the same priority meet, they are
served according to their order in the queue. In a normal queue, the
\"first in first out\" rule is implemented, while in a priority queue,
the values are removed based on priority. The highest priority element
is removed first \[[[Queue as data structure, types, implementation,
application,\/drakongobook/. (intellect.icu]{.underline}]{.mark})\].

Queued data storage is widely used to plan CPU, printer, and other
output tasks. The FIFO method is used when processing interrupts.

## 1.3.  Nonlinear abstract data types

This subsection considers nonlinear data structures, which include the
most common structures, namely *trees and graphs*. Recall that nonlinear
data structures allow the expression of more complex relationships
between elements than linear neighbourhood relationships, as in linear
structures.

### 1.3 1. Trees as ATD
In the abstract representation, trees are
understood as non-linear data structures consisting of nodes
representing a hierarchy of relationships (parent-children). Each vertex
of the tree, if there are descendants, is connected to them by direct
edges (Figure 1.9).

```{image} C:/Users/ISA_PC/.jupyter/projectBook/drakongo/Engl_images/E_Im1/Fig1_9_Tree.jpg
:width: 300px
:align: center
```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1.9. Basic tree terminology</p>

Let's give a definition of the basic concepts of the theory of trees.

*Root*: The root of the tree is the only node without any incoming
edges. This is the top node of the tree;

*Node*: This is the fundamental element of the tree. Each node has data
and two links that can point to null or its descendants;

*Edge:* This is also the fundamental part of the tree that is used to
connect two nodes.

*Path:* A path is an ordered list of nodes connected by edges.

*Leaf:* A leaf knot is a knot that has no descendants.

*Tree height:* Tree height is the number of edges on the longest path
between the root and the leaf.

*Node level:* Node level - number of edges on the path from the root
node of this node*.*

Several computational tasks require the organization of data in
different types of trees, but binary trees (binary tree) \[DSA\] are
particularly well studied and common. Within the concept of abstract
data types, a binary tree is a set of connected nodes in which each node
contains a value (the data element itself) and has no more than two
children. This means that the power of the binary tree is zero or one or
two. From the ATD perspective, binary trees contain values of elements
of type T. The load-bearing set of this type is the set of all binary
trees whose vertices are of type T. The carrying set thus includes an
empty tree, trees only with root of type T, trees with root and left
child, trees with root and right daughters, and so on.

To the degree of the vertices, binary trees are: strict - the vertices
of the tree have a degree of zero (in the leaves) or two (in the nodes);
weaker - the vertices of the tree have a degree of zero (in the leaves),
one or two (in the nodes). In general, a k-level binary tree can have up
to 2k-1 vertices. A binary tree containing only fully populated levels
(that is, 2k-1 vertices on each k level) is called complete. Binary tree
species are shown in Figure 1.10.

```{image} C:/Users/ISA_PC/.jupyter/projectBook/drakongo/Engl_images/E_Im1/Fig1_10_Tree.jpg
:width: 500px
:align: center
```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1.10. Binary tree species</p> 

Common operations for binary trees as abstract data types are:

-   Insert *k*-th element;

-   Remove *k*-th element;

-   Search for an element with the specified value *k*;

-   Find the maximum value stored in the tree;

-   Find the minimum value stored in the tree.

-   Find the number of tree levels.

The implementation of basic algorithms for binary search trees is
presented in Section 8.

### 1.3.2. Graphs like ATD
In the most general definition, a graph G is
given by a set of vertices {V} and a set of edges {E} connecting all or
part of these vertices. In other words, a graph G is completely defined
by a pair of{V, E}. If edges are oriented, which is usually shown by an
arrow, then they are called arcs, and the graph with such edges is
called a directed (directed) graph (Figure 1.11 a). If edges have no
orientation, then the graph is called non-directed (undirected) (Figure
1.11):

```{image} C:/Users/ISA_PC/.jupyter/projectBook/drakongo/Engl_images/E_Im1/Fig1_11_Graph.jpg
:width: 400px
:align: center
```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1.11. View of graph a)- non-directed; b) - directed</p>

Vertices and edges are called graph elements, the number of vertices in
the graph is an order, the number of edges is the size of the graph. The
vertices (u,v) are called the endpoints of the e = {u,v}, and the two
endpoints of the same edge are called adjacent. Two edges are called
adjacent if they have a common endpoint. Two edges are called multiples
if the sets of their endpoints are the same. An edge is called a loop if
its ends coincide, that is, e = {u,u}. If the vertex vi is the beginning
or end of the edge ek, then they (vertex and edge) are incident. The
number of edges incident to a vertex is called the vertex degree (Figure
1.12.).

```{image} C:/Users/ISA_PC/.jupyter/projectBook/drakongo/Engl_images/E_Im1/Fig1_12_Graph.jpg

<p style="text-align: center;"Figure 1.12. Basic graph parameters</p>

There are many types of graphs, among which the most significant are:

-   a zero graph in which there are no edges;

-   a trivial graph with only one vertex;

-   a non-directed graph in which the edges have no direction;

-   a directional graph in which the edges have directions;

-   a complete graph in which each node has an edge to another node;

-   The weighted graph in which the edges are specified with the weight.

Accordingly, there are many operations with graph elements, in
particular:

▪ add an edge between two vertices;

▪ operation to remove an edge while maintaining all vertices of the
graph;

▪ operation of adding a vertex to a set of vertices;

▪ operation of adding this rib to the set of ribs;

▪ Dijkstra operation, which determines the minimum distance between two
given nodes.

More detailed graph algorithms are discussed in SECTION 9.
