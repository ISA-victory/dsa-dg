# SECTION 2. GOLANG PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE OVERVIEW

## 2.1. What is the Go Programming Language?

Since this work uses an integrated approach to software implementation
of algorithms, it is necessary to at least briefly describe the basic
concepts and constructions of its components: visual algorithmic
language DRAKON and programming language Golang. It is thought that this
approach is very promising, foremost, in the field of education, because
it promotes the formation and development of algorithmic, computer
thinking and is quite justified for application in the field of computer
science as data structures and algorithms. However, it is assumed that
the reader is familiar with at least one of the modern programming
languages. At the same time, the Golang language description is limited
to constructs sufficient to understand data structure algorithms.

This section focuses on the features of software constructions:
_variables, arrays, slicess, maps, pointers, logical operators, cycles,
structures, recursion,_ etc. Special emphasis is placed on the
description of data types both basic and user. It is also considered to
be an interface. Everything that goes beyond \"Data structures and
algorithms\" is presented in various materials, which are given both in
the course of the text and in the list of literature.

Golang (Go) is a general-purpose language designed with system
programming in mind. The language was originally developed at Google in
2007 by Robert Grizemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson. It is strongly and
statically typed (requires precise indication of types of variables),
provides built-in support for garbage collection and supports parallel
programming [\]. The following are the most important features of Go
programming language.

- Simple and clear syntax. This makes writing code a pleasant
  occupation.

- Static typing. Avoids inadvertent errors, simplifies the reading and
  understanding of code, makes code unambiguous.

  - Speed and compilation. Go's speed is ten times faster than
    scripting languages, with less memory consumption. At the same
    time, the compilation is almost instantaneous. The whole project
    is compiled into one binary file, without dependencies. As they
    say, \"just add water\". And you don't have to worry about
    memory, you have a garbage collector.

  - Deviation from the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP).
    The language does not have classes, but there are data
    structures with methods. Inheritance is replaced by an embedding
    mechanism. There are interfaces that do not need to be
    explicitly implemented, but only enough to implement the
    interface methods.

- Parallelism. Parallel computations in the language are simple and
  graceful. Gorutins (something like threads) are lightweight, consume
  little memory.

- Rich standard library. The language has everything necessary for web
  development and not only. The number of third-party libraries is
  constantly growing. You can also use C and C++ libraries.

- Ability to write in a functional style. The language has closures
  (closures) and anonymous functions. Functions are first-order
  objects, they can be passed as arguments and used as data types.

## 2.2. Program structure in Go

The structure of the program in the language Golang is presented in
Figure 2.1.

:width: 400px
:align: center
```

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2.1. Program structure in Go language</p>

Every program on Go is a package. Depending on its content, this package can be the main program file, or a library with problem-oriented code. 
```go package main
package main
import ("fmt")
```
Here main function means that its contents will be executed after the program is run. In addition to it, the program can have as many other functions

```go package main 
func main() {

// function content

fmt.Println(\"Hello World\")

}
```
Comments in Go exist in two types: single-line and multi-line.

// - one-line commentary;

/\* \*/ - multiline comment placed between these symbols

## 2.3. Variables and constants

A variable in any programming language assigns a storage location for a value associated with a symbolic name or identifier. One variable or list of variables used in the program is declared via the keyword var. Values are assigned to variables by the sign \"=\". When declaring a variable, you must specify its type so that the compiler knows how to process it. That is why the language Go is called strictly typed.
```
var i int
var s string
var f bool,
```
here i is an integer variable; s is a string variable, f is a logical variable.

When declaring a variable, you can assign initial values that can be changed later:

```go package main package main
var a int = 25
var a, b, c int 100, 200 300
var y = float32 = 32.5
var z string = \"Input new value "\
```
In the absence of initial values, the variables are either zeroed (for numeric types) or filled in with empty lines (for string data). It is possible to briefly declare variables via the operator *:=*, for example *a := 2.5*. However, in this case, the variable is local, that is, only available in a separate fragment of the program.

Assigning variable names should be based on certain rules and style:

- variable names can only contain one word (without spaces).

- variable names can only contain letters, digits and underscore
  characters (\_).

- variable names cannot start with digits.

The variables are case-sensitive, but the case of the first letter of the variable name in Go is particularly important. If the variable name starts with a capital letter, this means that the variable is available outside the package where it was declared (the exported variable). If the variable name starts with a lowercase letter, it will only be available in the package where it is declared.

Constants are program objects whose values do not change in the program code. Constants are declared with the keyword: *const*:
```go package main
const item string
const n int
const y float64
```
It is allowed to assign initial values without declaring type:
```go package main
const item = "name"
const n = 25
const  y = 45.5
```

## 2.4. Input and output

Data entry is done by using the Scan(&Variable Name) function to simply put the entered value into a variable or Scanf(%format, &Variable Name) to pre-specify the type of data to be entered.

To implement the data output at the beginning of the program (after
package main), the corresponding *fmt*-package is imported, which contains many output functions depending on the type of variables, location and explanatory string enclosed in double quotation marks ( n - line translation). The prefix *fmt* is used to communicate with the corresponding package.
```go package main
fmt.Print ("Hello") // output without newline
fmt.Println () // output with cursor to new line
fmt.Printf() // outputting variable values to text
fmt.fmt.Printf(\"Hello %d\\n\", 23) // print string and integer type
fmt.Fprint(\"Hello \", 23, \"\\n\") //same with newline
fmt.fmt.Println(\"Hello\", 23) // string and number output
fmt.Printf(\"This year I passed %v the cities, \", &output)
```
For example:
```go package main
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
var name string
var salary int
fmt.Println(\"Enter last name \")
fmt.Scanf(\"%s \\n\", &name)
fmt.Println(\"Enter salary \")
fmt.Scanf(\"%d \\n\", &salary)
fmt.Printf(\"%s \\n\",name)
fmt.Printf(\"%d \\n\",salary)
fmt.Printf(\"Salary %s is %d dollars \", name, salary)
Output:
Enter last name
Smith
Enter salary
32000
Smith
32000
Smith's salary is 32,000 rubles
}
```
## 2.5. Golang decision making

When solving a multitude of problems, the problem arises of choosing a further way of solving depending on some conditions. In the Go language, this possibility is implemented by the following constructions:

- selection by condition: *if else; switch case; select*;

- repetition of commands using iterations: *for (range)*;

- change of behavior in the course of iterations: *break and continue*.

a). Conditional statement *if-else*

The Go language uses three decision-making constructs or, in other
words, a choice of further computational process: if-else, switch and select. The syntax of the first operator is as follows:
```go package main
if condition {
// executable code provided condition == true
} else {
//executable code provided condition == false
}
```

For a single comparison, curly braces can be omitted. The opening
bracket stays on the same line as the condition:
```go package main
package main
import ("fmt"
)

func main() {
// if the conditionis correct
if ID == "Apple" {
//what is done is what is in brackets:
fmt.Println("enter your login and password ")
//if the condition is not met, then you can immediately check
//another condition. You can do this any number of times 
} else if ID =="Google" {
// get the second answer
fmt.Println("Your operating system is not supported ")
// do what belongs to the last if
} else {
fmt.Println("Input error")
}
}
```

b). Switch statement

The switch expression switch provides a simple way to access different parts of the program based on the value of the expression. Syntax of switch statement:

switch optstatement; optexpression{
case expression1: Statement..
case expression2: Statement..
...
default: Statement..
}

After the first variant found, the operator performs the necessary
actions and stops work.
```go package main
switch ID {
// first value is checked
case \"Apple\":
fmt.Println(\"Enter your username and password \")
// second value is checked
case \"Google\":
fmt.Println(\"second value is checked \")
// if nothing was found
default:
fmt.Println(\"Input error \")
}
```

c). Select statement

The select statement allows you to select one of several expressions to execute. The main difference between select and switch is that select works on a standby basis. This means that the select command will not run until the message associated with sending and receiving on any channel is executed. It should be noted that the visual algorithmic language DRAKON in the implementation of the editor Drakon Web Editor uses a similar operator Select, which will be discussed in the next section.

## 2.6 Loops

The Golang language adopts only one loop format - *for*, which has the following variants.

a). The classical, C-like cycle with variable, condition and cycle step:
```go package main
for i := 0; i < 8; i++ { loop body }
```
b). Preconditioned loop

The simplest loop is to declare only the condition, and place the rest inside the loop:
```go package main
package main
import (
  "fmt"
)  
func main() {
// loop variable
var count = 10
// as long as the variable is greater than 0 --- the loop runs
for count \> 0 {
// output the current value of the variable
fmt.Println(count)
// output the current value of the variable
count = count - 1
}
```
c) Loop within range

There is another for loop variation that iterates the range of values for the data type. The range keyword is used in a cycle to iterate the elements of an array, slice or map. When using an array and a slice, the loop returns an index of the element as an integer. When using cards, it returns the key-value of the following pair:
```go package main
package main
import \"fmt\"
func main() {
nums := \[\]int{2, 3, 4}
sum := 0
for \_, num := range nums {
sum += num
}
fmt.Println(\"sum:\", sum)
for i, num := range nums {
if num == 3 {
fmt.Println(\"index:\", i)
}
}
kvs := map\[string\]string{\"ca\": \"Paris\", \"co\": \"France\"}
for k, v := range kvs {
fmt.Printf(\"%s -\> %s\\n\", k, v)
}
for k := range kvs {
fmt.Println(\"key:\", k)
}
}
```
The following table provides a complete list of Golang keywords:
```go package main
     1       !    2   !    3    !      4      !    5   
  -----------!--------!---------!-------------!--------  
  break      !  case  !  chan   !    const    ! continue

  default    ! defer  !  else   ! fallthrough !  for 

  func        !   go  !  goto   !     if      ! import 

  interface   !   map ! package !    range    ! return 

  select      ! struct   switch !     type    !   var
```

## 2.7. Data types

Data types define the types of values that are saved by variables when writing the program. Data types also help identify operations that can be performed using data. The following types of data types are dislocated.

- Fundamental types. This category includes numbers, strings, and
  logical (boolean) values.

- Aggregate types. This category includes array and structures.

- Reference types. This category includes *pointers, cuts, associative   array (map) and, functions*.

- Embedding types. Go supports user-defined types as *aliases* or
  *structures*.

### 2.7.1. Basic types

а). Integer and real types of variables and constants

Integer Go types are divided into whole with a sign and whole without a sign. Integer types with the sign include int, int8, int16, int32, and int64; whole types without the sign include *uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr*. The range of values and amount of occupied memory of integer types are represented in the table. 2.1:
```go package main

<p style="text-align: write;">Table. 2.1 Integer types</p>
  type !          Range                  !Occupied computer memory!
  -----!---------------------------------!------------------------!
int8   !       128 ---  127              !      8 bit (1 bytes)   !
uint8  !         0 --- 255               !                        !
int16  !    32 768 --- 32 767            !     16 bit (2 bytes)   !
uint16 !         0 --- 65535             !                        !
int32  ! 2 147 483 648 --- 2 147 483 647 !      bit (4 bytes)     !
uint32 !    0 --- 4 294 967 295          !                        !
int64  ! -9 223 372 036 854 775 808      !    64 bit (8 bytes)    !
       !  --- 9 223 372 036 854 775 807  !                        !
uint64 !0 --- 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 !                        !
```

The Go language adopts two floating point number formats:.

- *float32* - The largest float32 is the constant *math.MaxFloat32*, which is about 3.4e38.    The lowest positive value is 1.4e-45/.
- *float64* - The largest float64 is the constant *math.MaxFloat64*, which is about 1.8e308. The smallest positive value is 4.9e-324.

Float32 provides about six decimal places of accuracy, while float64 provides about 15 digits. The float64 type is preferable for most problems, because when float32 is used, many iterative algorithms quickly accumulate a roundoff error.

To determine to which data type the Go compiler assigns a variable, the Printf() function is used, the parameters of which have a special symbol %T:
```go package main
а := 234,45
fmt.Printf("Type %T for %v\n", a, a)
```

b). String variables and constants

A string is an immutable sequence of bytes. Strings may contain
arbitrary data, including bytes with the value 0, but usually contain readable text. Text strings are usually interpreted as *UTF-8*-encoded sequences of code points. The built-in len function returns the number of bytes per string, and the print operator of the *%x* specification returns one byte of *s* for the Latin alphabet:
```go package main
func main() {
s := "Hello, World"
fmt.Println("String >> ", s)
fmt.Println("String lengh= ", len(s))
fmt.Println("Hex bytes: ")
for i := 0; i < len(s); i++ {
fmt.Printf(" %x",s[i])
}
fmt.Println()
q := " Hello, World"
fmt.Println()
fmt.Println("String >> ", q)
fmt.Println("String length = ", len(q))
for i := 0; i < len(q); i++ {
fmt.Printf(" %x",q[i])
}
Output:
String а >> Hello, World
String length = 12
Hex bytes:
48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 57 6f 72 6c 64
String >> Hello, World
String length = 20
d0 9f d1 80 d0 b8 d0 b2 d0 b5 d1 82 2c 20 d0 9c d0 b8 d1 80
```

c) Logical variables and constants

The logical data type (bool) can be either true (truth) or false
(falsehood). Boolean operators are used in programming to compare and control data flow:
```go package main
func main() {
x := 5
y := 8
fmt.Println("x == y:", x == y)
fmt.Println("x != y:", x != y)
fmt.Println("x < y:", x < y)
fmt.Println("x > y:", x > y)
fmt.Println("x <= y:", x <= y)
fmt.Println("x >= y:", x >= y)
}
Output:
x != y: true
x < y: true
x > y: false
x <= y: true
x >= y: false
```

### 2.7.2 Aggregate types

а) Array

An array is a series of fixed-length data that is used to store
homogeneous elements in memory. Arrays in Go are almost identical to arrays in other programming languages. Array elements are indexed using the \[\] index with their zero position, which means that the first
element index is array\[0\] and the last element index is
array\[len(array)-1\], where len(array) is the array length. However,
due to the fixed length of arrays are not very popular unlike the Slice
(Cut) design, which is incomparably used in Go. The syntax of the array
looks like this:

\[N\]T{value1, value2, value3, \...value n}, где N -- numbers of
elements

b\) Structure

Structure design is the type of data defined by the developer and serves to represent any real objects. Structures contain a set of fields that represent different attributes of an object. Type and struct keywords are used to define the structure:
```go package main
type s_name struct{

structures fields

}
```
The following is an example of an enterprise employee data
structure:
```go package main
package main

import (
  "fmt"
)

type Employee struct {
firstName, lastName, address string // string type fields
age, phone, salary int // integer type fields
}
func main() {
// structure initialization
emp := Employee{firstName: "Max", lastName: "Smith", age: 42,
phone: 123456789, salary: 34000, address: " Amarillo "}
fmt.Println("first and last names:", emp.firstName, emp.lastName)
fmt.Println("Employee age:", emp.age)
fmt.Println("Employee salary:", emp.salary)
fmt.Println("Employee telephone:", emp.phone)
fmt.Println("Employee address:", emp.address)
}
```
The memory for a new struct variable is allocated using the new
function, which returns a pointer to the allocated memory:
```go package main
var w *T = new(T),
```
or in different lines if the structure is declared in the package area:
```go package main
var w *T
w = new(T)
```
When using the short form of assigning a variable value (:=), that is, w:= new(T), the variable z is a pointer to a memory area where the structure fields contain null values according to their types:
```go package main
type structEmpl struct {
name string
age int
salary float64
}
func main() {
ms := new(structEmpl)
fmt.Println(ms)
ms.name = "Fangur"
ms.age = 45
ms.salary = 1200.5
//fmt.Printf(\"Last name: %s\\n\", ms.name)
fmt.Printf("Age: %d\n", ms.age)
fmt.Printf("Salary: %8.1f\n", ms.salary)
fmt.Println(ms)
}
```

### 2.7.3 Refetence types

а) Pointer

Pointers in the Golang programming language are variables that are used to store the memory address of another variable. Variables are used to store some data at a specific memory address in the system. The memory address is always represented in hexadecimal format (starting from 0x, for example, 0xFFAAF, etc.) (Figure 2.2):

```{image} C:/Users/ISA_PC/.jupyter/projectBook/drakongo/Engl_images/E_Im2/Fig2_2_Memory.jpg
:width: 300px
:align: center
```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2.2. Variable, pointer, memory</p>

The pointer is usually called a special type of variable. The main and only operators of the pointers are: the dereferential operator (*) and the address operator (&). The dereferencing operator (\*) is used to declare a pointer variable and access the value stored in the address. The address operator (&) is used to return the address of the variable or to access the address of the variable index.
Pointer declaration syntax:

_var pointer name *Data Type_

here _*Data Type_ - any valid data type, for example,
_var pos *string_.

To work with the pointer, it must be initialized with the memory address of another variable using the *&address* statement, as shown in the following example:
```go package main
var a = 124
var s *int = &a
```
The uninitialized index will always have a zero value of *<nil>*. Here is an example of index initialization and processing:
```go package main
func main() {
var z1, z2 int = 64, 128
var p1, p2 *int
p1 = &z1 // p1 pointer initialized
fmt.Println("Variable value z1 = ", z1)
fmt.Println("Address z1 = ", &z1)
fmt.Println("Variable value z2 = ", z2)
fmt.Println("Address z2 = ", &z2)
// p2 pointer is uninitialized
fmt.Println("The value saved in the variable p1 = ", p1)
fmt.Println("The value saved in the variable p2 = ", p2)
}

Output:
Variable value z1 = 64
Address z1 = 0xc000086080
Variable value z2 = 128
Address z2 = 0xc000086088
```
The value saved in the variable *p1 = 0xc000086080*.
The value saved in the variable *p2 = <nil>*.
The dereference operator * is used to declare a pointer variable and to access the value stored in the variable to which the pointer points:
```go package main
func main() {
var y = 157
var p = &y
fmt.Println(\"Variable value in y = \", y)
fmt.Println(\"Variable address y = \", &y)
fmt.Println(\"Value saved in p = \", p)
fmt.Println(\"Value saved in  y(\*p) = \", \*p)
}

Output:
Variable value in y = 157
Variable address y = 0xc000014078

Value stored in p = 0xc000014078

Value stored in y(\*p) = 157б)
```

b) Slice

Slices are sequences of variable length, all of whose elements are of the same type. The slice type "[] T" is written, where the elements are of type T.

There are three components:

*Pointer:* The pointer points to an array element that is accessible
through a cut, which is not necessarily the first element of the array.

*Length* - the number of slice t elements. It cannot exceed the capacity.

*Capacitance*: The capacitance is usually the number of elements between the beginning of the slice and the end of the base array representing the change.

The built-in len and cap functions contain slice length and capacitance values respectively. Multiple slices can share the same base array and can refer to overlapping parts of that array. The first position of the index in the slice is always 0, and the last is the slice length minus one (len- 1). The slice declared in the same way as the array, but it does not contain a slice size. Thus, it can grow or decrease according to some algorithm.

The syntax of the slice design is as follows:

*[]T* или *[]T{}* или *[]T{value1, value2, value3, ...value n}*,

here *T* is the element type. For example:

*var my_slice [] int*

Figure 2.3) shows the visual representation of the cut
through its components - pointer (ptr), length (len) and capacitance
(cap):

```{image} C:/Users/ISA_PC/.jupyter/projectBook/drakongo/Engl_images/E_Im2/Fig2_3_Slice.jpg
:width: 300px
:align: center
```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure.2.3. Representation of slicing in memory through components</p>

Slices can be created from existing slices with corresponding indices (Figure 2.4):
```go package main
package main
import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
var sr = []int{17, -21, 5, 62, 24, 48, 78, -43}
sr0 := sr[2:6]
fmt.Println("sr0 = ", sr0)
sr1 := sr[2:]
fmt.Println("sr1 = ", sr1) // prints \[5 7 9 11 13 15\]
sr2 := sr1[:3]
fmt.Println("sr2 = ", sr2)
}
```

```{image} C:/Users/ISA_PC/.jupyter/projectBook/drakongo/Engl_images/E_Im2/Fig2_4_NewSlice.jpg
:width: 400px
:align: center
```
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2.4. Create new slice from existing one</p>

It is important to note that each created slice sr0, sr1, sr2 has its own memory, that is, all created slices have different addresses, even if they are fragments of one slice.:

*sr --> 0xc000004078;  sr0 --> 0xc000004090;* 
*sr1 --> 0xc0000040c0; sr2 --> 0xc0000040f0*

### 2.7.3. Associative arrays (Map)

Associative arrays (later cards) are storage containers of the pair
_"key-value"_. Maps are one of the most common and useful data
structures. Unlike data structures such as arrays or cut-offs, maps
provide quick and efficient searches for elements. The map does not
allow duplicate keys, but may have duplicate values.

The announcement syntax of the card with the key type int and the
value - string:

*var names map[int] string*

The card can be initialized in two ways:
using the function *make()*: *var names = make(map\[int\]string);*
using literal syntax: *var films = map[int]string;*

Here is an example illustrating both methods of initialization of the map:
```go package main
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	names := map[int]string{0: "Cameron", 1: "Spielberg",
  2: "Lee", 3: " Donner"}
	fmt.Println(names)
	films := make(map[string]string)
	films["Cameron"] = " The Abyss"
	films["Spielberg"] = " The Goonies"
	films["Lee"] = "Jungle Fever"
	films["Donner"] = "Superman"
	fmt.Sprintln(films)
	for key, value := range films {
		fmt.Println(" \n", key, ">", value)
	}
}
Output:

map[0:Cameron 1:Spielberg 2:Lee 3: Donner]
 
 Cameron >  The Abyss
 
 Spielberg >  The Goonies
 
 Lee > Jungle Fever
 
 Donner > Superman
```

## 2.8. Functions and Methods

### 2.8.1 Functions
A function is a group of operators that share a task. With the help of functions you can repeatedly call its operator block as a unit in other parts of the program. Functions in Go can be assigned to variables, passed as an argument, and can be returned from another function. When declaring a function, you need to specify what type of variables are transferred to the function(s) and what type of data the function returns (return values). In Go, you must specify the data type for each parameter. To declare a function, the keyword func is used. The general structure of the function declaration is shown below:
```go package main
func name  (Parameters) (Returned types)
{
Function body
}
```
The multiplication function of the two real numbers *multiply(x,y)* is as follows:

```go package main
package main
import "fmt"
func multiply(x,y float64) float64 {
var res
res = x \* y
return res // return result
}

func main() { // function performed
var x float64 = 15
var y float64 = 120.6
var mult float64 // variable for result
mult = multiply(x,y) // function calculation
fmt.Print(mult) // outputting
}
```
The function can return as many values as required:
```go package main
func main() {
var a, b int = 60, 20
vAdd, vSub := addSub(a, b)
fmt.Printf(\"a + b = %d\\n\", vAdd) // prints \"35 + 25 = 60\"
fmt.Printf(\"a - b = %d\\n\", vSub) // prints \"35 - 25 = 10\"
}

func addSub(x, y int) (int, int) { // multiple return values (int, int)
return x + y, x - y
}
```
An important feature of functions in Go is the ability to accept
parameters by value or by reference \[\].

### 2.8.2 Methods

Methods together with functions provide different ways of organizing
program code. A method in Go is a function associated with a particular type that acts on a variable of a certain type called a receiver (recipient). The Golang language does not support the Class concept common in other languages. It is with the method that the object provides its properties, including the behavior of the object. The method must meet the following conditions: it must be of a certain type and must be defined in the same package.

The method declaration looks like a function declaration, but it has an additional part of the parameter declaration. An optional parameter can contain one and only one parameter of the method recipient type. The recipient parameter should be enclosed in parentheses between the func keyword and the method name.
```go package main
Func (_Receiver name_ Type) _Method name_ (Parameters)(Return type){

// Operator block

}
```
In Go, it is allowed to define a method whose receiver has a structure type. This receiver is available inside the method as shown in the following example. The rec receiver structure describing the rect object is declared:
```go package main
type rect struct {

var width, height int

}
```
Two methods are associated with this structure that determine the
behavior of the object described by the structure *rect*:

```go package main
func (r rect) area() int { 
return r.width * r.height 

func (r rect) perim() int { 
return 2*(r.width + r.height) 
}
```

## 2.9. Interface type 

Golang is not a classical object-oriented language, that is, it does not support the implementation of the concept of \"classes\" and \"inheritance\" in a direct way. However, Go contains a very flexible concept of interfaces that provides many aspects of object-oriented programming.

Interfaces in Go provide a way to indicate the behavior of an object by a set of methods defined by the interface type. An interface-type variable can store any type of value with a set of methods, which is any superset of the interface. The concept of interface allows to organize different groups of methods applied to objects of different nature. In other words, interfaces are collections of method signatures declaring name, type parameters, and return types of methods in the interface.

The syntax of the interface is as follows:

```go package main
type Namer interface { // Namer -- interface type

Method1(param_list) return_type
Method2(param_list) return_type
```
For example, you need to create a method to determine the area of
geometric shapes - circle and rectangle.

```go package main
type shape interface {
area() float64
perimeter() float64
}
```
This code defines the interface for shapes and declares two functions, *area()* and *perimeter()* with a return *float64* type.
```go package main
package main
import (
    "fmt" 
)
// Interface declarationtype shape interface {
area() float64
perimeter() float64
}
// Outline declaration \"rectangle\"type rectangle struct{
length, height float64
}
// Declaration of the \"circle structure
type circle struct{
radius float64
}
// Declaring Methods for a Rectangle

func (r rectangle) area() float64 {
return r.length \* r.height
}

func (r rectangle) perimeter() float64 {
return 2 * ( r.length + r.height)
}

// Declaration of methods for the circle
func (c circle) area() float64 {
return 3.142 * c.radius * c.radius
}
func (c circle) perimeter() float64 {
return 2 * 3.142 * c.radius
}
func main() {
r := rectangle{length: 10.0, height: 5.0}
c := circle{radius: 5.0}
fmt.Printf("Rectangle area - %8.1f\n", r.area())
fmt.Printf("Rectangle perimeter - %8.1f\n", r.perimeter())
fmt.Printf("" - %8.1f\n", c.area())
fmt.Printf("Circumference - %8.1f\n", c.perimeter())
}

Output:

Rectangle Area - 50.0
Rectangle Parimeter - 30.0
Circle area - 78.5
Lap Circummetre - 31
```

## Conclusion

It should be noted once again that this section provides basic
information on the programming language Golang, sufficient to understand the material set out later. Outside the section such information as Go-subroutines and channels, parallelism and shared variables, packages and tools go, reflection, etc. Next, in the relevant sections will explain in more detail the tools and constructions, as set out in this section. In addition, the recursion tool will be explained in detail because of its special value for iterative processes in data structure processing algorithms.

In addition, it should be noted that in this book, which implements the concept of hybrid programming, linear constructions of the Go language are used as filling icons of the visual algorithmic language DRAKON. Other designs, in particular, cycles in the range or operator Select is different from Go-designs. Moreover, some DRAKON language designs are converted into other designs during the automatic generation of code. In particular, the software implementation of the Select statement is converted into a composite if-else choice operator. This is due to the desire of the authors of the DRAKON language to make the generated code
more efficient, increasing its speed and saving computer memory.
